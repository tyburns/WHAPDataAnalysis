Add to main script: compare precision of estimates to objective precision. Report at subunit and refuge level. Detection of change over time. Make a table with achieved precision, desired precision and whether desired was achieved. Make list of possible metrics for defining objectives. Look at Table 1.4 in main framework file. https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WHAPImplementation/Shared%20Documents/Kern%20NWRC/KRN%20site-specific%20WHAP%20protocol/Kern%20WHAP%20objectives%20table%2020210622.docx?d=w08515c833a0e4a439d5315c125f43afb&csf=1&web=1&e=2eL4cY.

Management tracking: make example of management data file. Work with Kara on this.

Add code to output all subunits sampled in each refuge each year as a excel table. SurveHistory_YYYY.xlsx Include management actions. Get dictionary for management actions. Eric did some work on this.

Post data processing/validation script. Formalize.

Estimate the effect of number of quadrats on precision. Use proportions for each group as observed in reality. Use a procedure just based on the numbers of quadrats used in the past and the observed precisions.

Check if species-stratum mass/area are consistent across years.

Check Miro tasks.

Check GitHub issues.
