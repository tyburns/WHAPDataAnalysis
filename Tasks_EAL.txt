Review Therese's figure for sources of error. DONE.

Revise section on sources of error in Framework. DONE.

Work with Rebeca on report 2020 table. DONE.

Create model for SW and pass it on to Rebeca to run for 2021. DONE.

Create CI's for refuge-level estimates. DONE.

Write last section of SOP5: create and use model for dimension to seed head mass. Add model development and assessment section. DONE.

Add statement about d2m model performance in Sources of error framework. Refer to SOP 5. DONE.

Double check calculations for MDC 2021. Watergrass was too low?? DONE.

Revisit the calculation of variance due to estimation of area covered by each spp-stratum.DONE

Add to main script: compare precision of estimates to objective precision. Report at subunit and refuge level. Detection of change over time. Make a table with achieved precision, desired precision and whether desired was achieved. DONE

Make list of possible metrics for defining objectives. Look at Table 1.4 in main framework file. https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WHAPImplementation/Shared%20Documents/Kern%20NWRC/KRN%20site-specific%20WHAP%20protocol/Kern%20WHAP%20objectives%20table%2020210622.docx?d=w08515c833a0e4a439d5315c125f43afb&csf=1&web=1&e=2eL4cY. DONE. Use right-side CI in cumulative mass when units are sorted in decreasing total mass contribution.

********************************************************************************
Sampling objetives: +/- 25% with 90% confidence for places with amounts relevant for management and an absolute amount (10 g/m2?) for those that have little amount of the species. Sliding rule based on % of mean?. DONE. See Simulation based calculations.

We do not necessarily want to achieve the same CI width standard in units that produce little than on those that produce a lot or most of the food in the refuge. Factor in the impact of each unit on the total amount of food?. DONE

Maybe plot proportion of CI that are acceptable against the proportion of total food accounted for. DONE

Report precision of individual unit and its impact on precision of total food estimate.

10 Feb meting:

Make cumulative graphs for all three years. DONE
Write explanation for new objectives table. 
What is the reporting tool to determine if objectives have been achieved.
- 1A yes or no
- 2A yes or no for each subunit.
Repeat for each species and all together. DONE

********************************************************************************

Management tracking: make example of management data file. Work with Kara on this.

Add code to output all subunits sampled in each refuge each year as a excel table. SurveHistory_YYYY.xlsx Include management actions. Get dictionary for management actions. Eric did some work on this. Rebeca is working on management records. Check with them before moving on this.

Post data processing/validation script. Formalize.

Estimate the effect of number of quadrats on precision. Use proportions for each group as observed in reality. Use a procedure just based on the numbers of quadrats used in the past and the observed precisions. DONE

Check if species-stratum mass/area are consistent across years. DONE.

Check Miro tasks.

Check GitHub issues.

Kern separate unit 14?




****************** 17 Feb 2022 ***********************************
New tasks for simulation based precision:

Make figures taller so that bars can be seen 

Add to the cumulative tables pass/fail column for if the cumulative estimate sampling objective is met  

Add star to the graph for if a cumulative refuge estimate passes


SOP4 complete just enough to understand what was used in 2019-2021 reports and detailed explanation of what is the simulation based calculation.

Go to WHAP 2 proposal and use to add section headings for SOP4.

SOP 4 – minimum detail on what analysis methods were in WHAP 2021, and short explanation of the new simulation based calculation method WHAP 2022 

– step by step instructions on running the analysis using multiple scripts (modules). New analyses will be added as separate modules.

**************** 4 Mar 2022 *************************************

Do a table with output of Sim Based estimates. DONE
Include colummns: g/m2 per unit and the corresponding CI. DONE
Include definition of all columns. DONE

********* WHAP 2 ***************

make model d2 mass generic as a function of dimensions.
Provide examples and refrences of d2mass models.
(Consider examples of species to model)
Use d2mass_model object in script assumnig it responds well to predict.
