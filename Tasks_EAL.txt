Add to main script: compare precision of estimates to objective precision. Report at subunit and refuge level. Detection of change over time. Make a table with achieved precision, desired precision and whether desired was achieved. Make list of possible metrics for defining objectives. Look at Table 1.4 in main framework file. https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WHAPImplementation/Shared%20Documents/Kern%20NWRC/KRN%20site-specific%20WHAP%20protocol/Kern%20WHAP%20objectives%20table%2020210622.docx?d=w08515c833a0e4a439d5315c125f43afb&csf=1&web=1&e=2eL4cY. Ask Rebeca to

********************************************************************************
Sampling objetives: +/- 20% with 80% confidence for places with amounts relevant for management and an absolute amount (10 g/m2?) for those that have little amount of the species. Sliding rule based on % of mean?

We do not necessarily want to achieve the same CI width standard in units that produce little than on those that produce a lot or most of the food in the refuge. Factor in the impact of each unit on the total amount of food?

Maybe plot proportion of CI that are acceptable against the proportion of total food accounted for.

Report precision of individual unit and its impact on precision of total food estimate.

********************************************************************************

Management tracking: make example of management data file. Work with Kara on this.

Add code to output all subunits sampled in each refuge each year as a excel table. SurveHistory_YYYY.xlsx Include management actions. Get dictionary for management actions. Eric did some work on this. Rebeca is working on management records. Check with them before moving on this.

Post data processing/validation script. Formalize.

Estimate the effect of number of quadrats on precision. Use proportions for each group as observed in reality. Use a procedure just based on the numbers of quadrats used in the past and the observed precisions. DONE

Check if species-stratum mass/area are consistent across years. DONE.

Check Miro tasks.

Check GitHub issues.

Kern separate unit 14?
